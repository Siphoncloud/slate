# Introduction

Welcome to the Siphon API! You can use our API to access Siphon API endpoints, which can allow you to filter traffic.

Multiple integrations exist already for popular CMS (Content Management Systems) like WordPress and Joomla, we also have a full integration for PHP already that can be downloaded inside your [dashboard](https://siphoncloud.com/dashboard/traffic-filter-resources.php).

# Traffic Endpoints
These endpoints allow for the sending of website traffic and receiving real-time judgements based on filter settings
# Visit
All visit endpoints are located at https://siphon-api.com/v3/visit/
